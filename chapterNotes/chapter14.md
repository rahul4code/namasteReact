## Steps to face to Machine Code Interview
- Requirements Clarification : In first 5 min
- What features to build
  - Techstack
    - To style your frontend app like Tailwind css for all the CSS with justification

`## The more planning you will do the better code you will write`

## What is Low Level Design ?
- Low-level design (LLD) refers to the detailed architectural and implementation design of a software system or component. It is a phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) that follows the high-level design (HLD) phase. While HLD focuses on the overall system architecture and functionality, LLD delves into the specifics of individual modules, classes, functions, and their interactions.\
  
PS: [Cover SDLC and HLD]

## useSearchParams
- In React, the useSearchParams hook is used to access and manipulate query parameters in the URL. It is part of the react-router-dom library, specifically the react-router-dom@^6.0.0 version.

      const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();

      // Updating Search Params
      
      searchParams.set('page', '2');
      setSearchParams(searchParams);
