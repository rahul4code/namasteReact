## Keep Notes 
- Never create a `functional component` inside functional component because it keeps creating the component for each render in this case keep it on the top level.
- Never ever write a useState inside `if else` because React keep tracks their own local state variable so React won't know about the variable. Also never write inside `for loop`. React never like inconsistency it should exactly knows what are the variables.
- useState provides a facility to create a local state for your component and according to the documentation never use useState outside of your component.
